"""Simple temporal check (free tier) — pure ffmpeg, zero extra dependencies.

Reads per-frame luma difference (signalstats YDIF) and reports a one-line hint
ONLY when evidence is strong. Two signals, both calibrated on labeled clips
(2026-07-17):
- padded slow-motion: duplicate ratio > 0.5 arranged as MANY SHORT runs
  (true 4x padding measures ~0.75 with hundreds of 1-4 frame runs; a freeze
  frame shows ONE long run and is deliberately ignored — editing, not speed).
- interval capture was evaluated for this tier and moved to Pro-only: pure
  frame-difference stats cannot separate it from fast-action sports footage.

The Pro tier (crv Pro --speed-check) does multi-channel per-segment analysis;
this free check is a conservative single-signal hint and stays silent unless
confident. Never claims "normal speed".
